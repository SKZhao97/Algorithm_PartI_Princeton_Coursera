Assignment 1

Designe Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java to implement the percolation checking algorithm based on weighedQuickUnionUF method and analyze the performance of algorithms.

Assignment 2

Implement two data strcutures, Deque.java and RandomizedQueue.java. The first is a queue that can add and remove at both the front and the end, the latter is a queue that can dequeue in a random sequeue. Deque is implemented by writting a LinkedList and RandomizedQueue is implemented by writting an Array. Interator is implemented for the structures and Permutation.java is a test class to evaluate.
