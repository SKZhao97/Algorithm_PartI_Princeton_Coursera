# Algorithm_PartI_Princeton_Coursera Assignments

## Assignment 1

Designe Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java to implement the percolation checking algorithm based on weighedQuickUnionUF method and analyze the performance of algorithms.

## Assignment 2

Implement two data strcutures, Deque.java and RandomizedQueue.java. The first is a queue that can add and remove at both the front and the end, the latter is a queue that can dequeue in a random sequeue. Deque is implemented by writting a LinkedList and RandomizedQueue is implemented by writting an Array. Interator is implemented for the structures and Permutation.java is a test class to evaluate.

## Assignment 3

Implement collinear points pattern recognition algorithms. A point class defines the algorithms to calculate the slope or to sort the x-y positions. The brute force class used the brute algorithm to search for the collinear points. And Fast search class is based on sorting and compartor.

## Assigment 4

Use Priority Queue to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

## Assignment 5

KD Tree
